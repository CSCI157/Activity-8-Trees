# Activity-8-Trees
Use the uploaded code that prints a tree. Add the following functionality:

1. Insert a node into a tree.  <br>
   This should be a method added to the tree class. This method should accept data as a parameter, and create a node with that data which is then inserted into the tree. Check for duplicates, if the data is a duplicate then don't insert it.

2. Delete a node from a tree. <br>
   This should be a method added to the tree class. This method should accept data as a parameter and delete the node with that data. This is a little bit trick if the node has both a left and right branch. You should try and figure out what to on your own, but the idea is of course out there on the internet.
