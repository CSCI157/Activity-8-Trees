# Activity-8-Trees
Use the uploaded code that prints a tree. Add the following functionality:

Delete a node from a tree. <br>
   This should be a method added to the tree class. This method should accept data as a parameter and delete the node with that data. This is a little bit trick if the node has both a left and right branch. You should try and figure out what to on your own, but the idea is of course out there on the internet.
